Description: A package with two functions which finding the greatest common divisor based on 
            Euclidian algorithm and finding the shortest path between two nodes in weighted graph 
            based on Dijkstra algorithm.
            The package is designed to provide an efficient method for computing the 
            greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers). The process of 
            this function identifies the largest number that can divide both integers 
            without leaving a remainder.
            In function Dijkstra you provide the data, first argument as a 
            data frame with three variables and variables should be edges of the graph with the weight of edge 
            and second argument should be started note as initial node. 
            Then function returns the shortest path from the initial node to each node as a vector.
